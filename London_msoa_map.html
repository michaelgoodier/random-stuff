  /*
  / Shiny 1.4 bumped jQuery from 1.x to 3.x which means jQuery's
  / on-ready handler (i.e., $(fn)) is now asyncronous (i.e., it now
  / really means $(setTimeout(fn)).
  / https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#breaking-change-document-ready-handlers-are-now-asynchronous
  /
  / Since Shiny uses $() to schedule initShiny, shiny>=1.4 calls initShiny
  / one tick later than it did before, which means staticRender() is
  / called renderValue() earlier than (advanced) widget authors might be expecting.
  / https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/2630
  /
  / For a concrete example, leaflet has some methods (e.g., updateBounds)
  / which reference Shiny methods registered in initShiny (e.g., setInputValue).
  / Since leaflet is privy to this life-cycle, it knows to use setTimeout() to
  / delay execution of those methods (until Shiny methods are ready)
  / https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet/blob/18ec981/javascript/src/index.js#L266-L268
  /
  / Ideally widget authors wouldn't need to use this setTimeout() hack that
  / leaflet uses to call Shiny methods on a staticRender(). In the long run,
  / the logic initShiny should be broken up so that method registration happens
  / right away, but binding happens later.

  // Our general strategy is to:
  // 1. Load the data URI in an Image() object, so we can get its pixel
  //    dimensions and the underlying image data. (We could have done this
  //    by not encoding as PNG at all but just send an array of RGBA values
  //    from the server, but that would inflate the JSON too much.)
  // 2. Create a hidden canvas that we use just to extract the image data
  //    from the Image (using Context2D.getImageData()).
  // 3. Create a TileLayer.Canvas and add it to the map.

  // We want to synchronously create and attach the TileLayer.Canvas (so an
  // immediate call to clearRasters() will be respected, for example), but
  // Image loads its data asynchronously. Fortunately we can resolve this
  // by putting TileLayer.Canvas into async mode, which will let us create
  // and attach the layer but have it wait until the image is loaded before
  // it actually draws anything.
